# Description

In this test can define in which netfilter flow in which stage you are going to print logs.

## Details

The allowed parameters are listed in the [**nftlb api documentation**](https://github.com/zevenet/nftlb).

This test allows us to find out if the `logs` field of our farm has been configured. If it is configured with the value that we have passed it, it means that it has been configured correctly.
