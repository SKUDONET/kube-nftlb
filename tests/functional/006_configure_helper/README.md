# Description

We can configure the helper of the layer 4 protocol to be balanced to be used.

## Details

The allowed parameters are listed in the [**nftlb api documentation**](https://github.com/zevenet/nftlb).

This test allows us to find out if the `helper` field of our farm has been configured. If it is configured with the value that we have passed it, it means that it has been configured correctly.
